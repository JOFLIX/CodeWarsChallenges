# The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.
#
# To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.
# Input
#
# Input will consist of a list of lists containing two items each. Each list contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.
#
# Note for F#: The input will be of (int list list) which is a List<List>
# Example Input
#
# [[18, 20],[45, 2],[61, 12],[37, 6],[21, 21],[78, 9]]
#
# Output
#
# Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.
# Example Output
#
# ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]

#BDD:
#The input willbe integer of giving the data as years and the value of handicarp
# The output should be a string of either two values in a list, the open or senior
# SUDO CODE:
# Our sudo code will be in python language:
# we will pass the data into a function openSnior
#return an argument with a branching if, and, and  a loop 'for .. in'
# SOLUTION ONE


def openOrSenior(data):
    return ["Senior" if m[0] > 54 and m[1] > 7 else "Open" for m in data]


# REFFERED SOLUTION

def openOrSenior(data):
  return ["Senior" if age >= 55 and handicap >= 8 else "Open" for (age, handicap) in data]


# CHALLENGE TWO
"""
Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.
As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(
So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1,1,1] as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:
```
[1,1,1,3,5,9,17,31,...]
```
But what if we started with [0,0,1] as a signature? As starting with [0,1] instead of [1,1] basically shifts the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:
```
[0,0,1,1,2,4,7,13,24,...]
```
Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.
Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if `n==0`, then return an empty array and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)
If you enjoyed this kata more advanced and generalized version of it can be found in the Xbonacci kata
